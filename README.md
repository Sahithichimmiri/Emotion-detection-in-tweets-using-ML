# Emotion-detection-in-tweets-using-ML-and-DL
This project focuses on emotion detection in tweets using both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. With the growing use of social media platforms like Twitter, understanding emotions expressed in text has become essential for applications such as sentiment analysis, mental health monitoring, customer service improvement, and content moderation. The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle and contains approximately 20,000 labeled tweets with two columns: text and emotion. The objective is to classify the emotional tone of tweets into categories such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, etc.

To achieve this, a variety of models were implemented, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest from the machine learning domain, and Bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM) and CNN-LSTM from deep learning. The text data was preprocessed through techniques such as lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword elimination, URL and user mention cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization. For feature representation, TF-IDF was used with ML models, while embedding layers were employed for deep learning architectures. Each model was trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

This project demonstrates a comparative analysis of multiple models and provides insights into their performance in understanding human emotions from short texts. Future enhancements could include experimenting with transformer-based models like BERT, expanding to multilingual emotion detection, or deploying the model as a real-time web API using tools like Flask or Streamlit. The implementation is done in Python using libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, NLTK, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
